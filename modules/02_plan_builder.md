Create a ist of candidate activities (e.g., attractions, restaurants, parks).  
Each activity includes location, estimated duration, and cost.

Use a simple loop to build days:

For each day:  
    pick Morning activity 
    pick Midday activity (close by)  
    pick Afternoon activity (different theme)  
    pick Evening restaurant
